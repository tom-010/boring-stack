I can create a project, where I can create then a bunch of todos. 
There is a table showing them to me where I can mark them done. 
The newest ones are at the top. 
I got a view displaying all my todos across all projects.

I can add another person to a todo of mine. 
He then sees the todo himself in his todos.
I can also add him to a project of mine. 
He then sees all todos.
