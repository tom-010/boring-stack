  description: Shows all my todos across all projects in a table.
  display:
    - My todos across all projects
    - In the table there is the todo name, status, priority
    - High priority, and low priority should be visually distinct. Low in non fat font as name, high the row should get a light grey background.
    - Show only the name of the todo, not the description and make a clear checkmark in the first column
  actions:
    - I can toggle a todo directly in the table
    - There is a edit button for each todo
    - There is a create button above the table
    - When clicking on the priority badge it should cycle through the states which are low, medium, high
    - I want to be able to delete a todo from the row directly, but only in a more dropdown menu
    - In every todo row, there should be a copy button, which copies the todo name
    - There is a copy button above the table, which copies all todos currently displayed as CSV to the clipboard
